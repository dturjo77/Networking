## Introduction to Wireless Networks
Wireless networks are commonly encountered in work or home environments, providing connectivity for devices. A key feature is the seamless connectivity across different networks, enabled by international standards managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

## IEEE 802.11 Standards
The IEEE oversees the 802 series of standards, with 802.11 specifically dedicated to wireless networks. References to "802.11" pertain to wireless network standards. These standards are continually evolving, so it's essential to consult the latest IEEE updates to identify the specific wireless network type in use.

Wireless standards vary in implementation, such as the number of antennas or radios, which influences theoretical link rates. Newer standards have progressively increased overall link rates.

## Wi-Fi Alliance
The Wi-Fi Alliance is another key organization in wireless networking. Devices certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance display a Wi-Fi trademark logo, ensuring interoperability with IEEE standards. Historically, networks were named by their IEEE designation (e.g., 802.11b or 802.11ax). Recently, generational names (e.g., Wi-Fi 6 for 802.11ax) have been introduced for better accessibility.

## Wi-Fi Generations and Standards
Older standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g are rarely used today and lack formal generational names, though they can be colloquially referred to as Wi-Fi 1, Wi-Fi 2, and Wi-Fi 3. Newer standards include Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) through Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be).

Standards operate on frequencies such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.

The following table summarizes major Wi-Fi standards, including their IEEE names, generational names, frequencies, and maximum theoretical link rates (based on standard references):

| IEEE Standard | Generational Name | Frequencies | Maximum Theoretical Link Rate |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 802.11 (legacy) | (Wi-Fi 1, colloquial) | 2.4 GHz | 2 Mbps |
| 802.11a | (Wi-Fi 2, colloquial) | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps |
| 802.11b | (Wi-Fi 3, colloquial) | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps |
| 802.11g | - | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps |
| 802.11n | Wi-Fi 4 | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz | 600 Mbps |
| 802.11ac | Wi-Fi 5 | 5 GHz | 6.9 Gbps |
| 802.11ax | Wi-Fi 6 / Wi-Fi 6E (extended) | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz | 9.6 Gbps |
| 802.11be | Wi-Fi 7 | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz | 46 Gbps |

## Mobile Wireless Networks
Beyond local 802.11 networks, mobile devices often use provider networks like 4G, LTE, or 5G.

- **4G/LTE**: LTE (Long Term Evolution) represents 4G technology, unifying GSM and CDMA standards. It supports download rates of approximately 150 Mbps. LTE Advanced (LTE-A) doubles this to 300 Mbps.
  
- **5G**: Introduced in 2020, 5G significantly enhances mobile network performance, aiming for 10 Gbps throughput in optimal configurations. Typical speeds range from 100 to 900 Mbps. 5G provides bandwidth comparable to home wired networks, revolutionizing mobile connectivity.

## Impacts of 5G
- Enables expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) footprint by removing bandwidth constraints.
- Allows faster data transfers over shorter periods.
- Speeds up notifications.
- Facilitates processing more data in the cloud due to increased transfer capacity.

## Satellite Networking
For remote locations without traditional internet access, satellite networking offers a non-terrestrial solution. It involves installing a satellite dish to send and receive data via orbiting satellites.

- **Speeds**: Commonly 100 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload, slower than terrestrial options.
- **Latency**: Traditional systems have ~250 ms up and ~250 ms down (500 ms round trip). Newer systems like Starlink offer 40 ms latency, with goals to reduce to 20 ms.
- **Advantages**: Provides connectivity in inaccessible areas by adding a dish for direct internet access.
- **Challenges**:
  - Higher cost and complexity.
  - Requires direct line of sight to the satellite; obstructions can degrade or interrupt service.
  - Susceptible to "rain fade" during storms, potentially requiring backups or waiting for conditions to improve.
