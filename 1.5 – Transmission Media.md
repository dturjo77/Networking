** Wireless Networks**

Wireless networks are commonly encountered in work or home environments, providing connectivity for devices. A key feature is the seamless connectivity across different networks, enabled by international standards managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

## IEEE 802.11 Standards
The IEEE oversees the 802 series of standards, with 802.11 specifically dedicated to wireless networks. References to "802.11" pertain to wireless network standards. These standards are continually evolving, so it's essential to consult the latest IEEE updates to identify the specific wireless network type in use.

Wireless standards vary in implementation, such as the number of antennas or radios, which influences theoretical link rates. Newer standards have progressively increased overall link rates.

## Wi-Fi Alliance
The Wi-Fi Alliance is another key organization in wireless networking. Devices certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance display a Wi-Fi trademark logo, ensuring interoperability with IEEE standards. Historically, networks were named by their IEEE designation (e.g., 802.11b or 802.11ax). Recently, generational names (e.g., Wi-Fi 6 for 802.11ax) have been introduced for better accessibility.

## Wi-Fi Generations and Standards
Older standards like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g are rarely used today and lack formal generational names, though they can be colloquially referred to as Wi-Fi 1, Wi-Fi 2, and Wi-Fi 3. Newer standards include Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) through Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be).

Standards operate on frequencies such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.

The following table summarizes major Wi-Fi standards, including their IEEE names, generational names, frequencies, and maximum theoretical link rates (based on standard references):

| IEEE Standard | Generational Name | Frequencies | Maximum Theoretical Link Rate |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 802.11 (legacy) | (Wi-Fi 1, colloquial) | 2.4 GHz | 2 Mbps |
| 802.11a | (Wi-Fi 2, colloquial) | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps |
| 802.11b | (Wi-Fi 3, colloquial) | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps |
| 802.11g | - | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps |
| 802.11n | Wi-Fi 4 | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz | 600 Mbps |
| 802.11ac | Wi-Fi 5 | 5 GHz | 6.9 Gbps |
| 802.11ax | Wi-Fi 6 / Wi-Fi 6E (extended) | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz | 9.6 Gbps |
| 802.11be | Wi-Fi 7 | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz | 46 Gbps |

## Mobile Wireless Networks
Beyond local 802.11 networks, mobile devices often use provider networks like 4G, LTE, or 5G.

- **4G/LTE**: LTE (Long Term Evolution) represents 4G technology, unifying GSM and CDMA standards. It supports download rates of approximately 150 Mbps. LTE Advanced (LTE-A) doubles this to 300 Mbps.
  
- **5G**: Introduced in 2020, 5G significantly enhances mobile network performance, aiming for 10 Gbps throughput in optimal configurations. Typical speeds range from 100 to 900 Mbps. 5G provides bandwidth comparable to home wired networks, revolutionizing mobile connectivity.

## Impacts of 5G
- Enables expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) footprint by removing bandwidth constraints.
- Allows faster data transfers over shorter periods.
- Speeds up notifications.
- Facilitates processing more data in the cloud due to increased transfer capacity.

## Satellite Networking
For remote locations without traditional internet access, satellite networking offers a non-terrestrial solution. It involves installing a satellite dish to send and receive data via orbiting satellites.

- **Speeds**: Commonly 100 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload, slower than terrestrial options.
- **Latency**: Traditional systems have ~250 ms up and ~250 ms down (500 ms round trip). Newer systems like Starlink offer 40 ms latency, with goals to reduce to 20 ms.
- **Advantages**: Provides connectivity in inaccessible areas by adding a dish for direct internet access.
- **Challenges**:
  - Higher cost and complexity.
  - Requires direct line of sight to the satellite; obstructions can degrade or interrupt service.
  - Susceptible to "rain fade" during storms, potentially requiring backups or waiting for conditions to improve.

**Ethernet Networking Standards**

These notes summarize the lecture on Ethernet in a simple, easy-to-understand way. I've broken it down into key sections with bullet points for clarity. Ethernet is basically the standard way computers connect over wired networks, and it's everywhere!

## What is Ethernet?
- Ethernet is the world's most popular networking standard for wired connections.
- If your computer is plugged into a network with a cable, it's likely using Ethernet.
- Almost any device (like computers, printers, or routers) can connect to an Ethernet network.

## Types of Ethernet
- Ethernet comes in many varieties, differing in:
  - **Speed**: How fast data travels (e.g., 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps).
  - **Cabling**: The type of wire used, like twisted-pair copper (common, like phone wires) or fiber-optic (uses light for faster, longer distances).
  - **Connectors**: The plugs at the ends of cables (e.g., RJ-45 for copper).
  - **Equipment**: Devices like switches or routers needed to link everything.
- Modern Ethernet supports standards for both copper and fiber-optic cables.

## Who Creates Ethernet Standards?
- All Ethernet networks follow a single set of rules, so any device can connect worldwide.
- Standards are made by the **IEEE 802.3 committee**.
  - IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
  - They design and document how Ethernet works, ensuring compatibility.

## Common Ethernet Standards (Examples)
- There are many standards, using different media (cables) and speeds. Here are popular ones:
  - **1000BASE-T**: Gigabit Ethernet over twisted-pair copper cable. Speed: 1 gigabit per second (1 Gbps).
  - **10GBASE-T**: 10 Gigabit Ethernet over twisted-pair copper. Speed: 10 Gbps.
  - **1000BASE-SX**: Gigabit Ethernet over fiber-optic cable. Speed: 1 Gbps.
- These are just a few—others exist for even faster speeds or different setups.

## Understanding Ethernet Standard Names
- Names like "1000BASE-T" give clues about the standard, but they're not always exact. Always check the full IEEE document for details.
- Break it down like this:
  - **Number at the start**: Relates to speed.
    - 1000 = 1,000 megabits per second (1 Gbps).
    - 10G = 10 gigabits per second (10 Gbps).
  - **BASE**: Stands for "baseband."
    - Means data is sent using a single frequency (simple and common).
    - Unlike "broadband," which uses multiple frequencies.
  - **Letters at the end**: Indicate the media (cable type) and other details.
    - T = Twisted-pair copper.
    - F = Fiber-optic.
    - SX = Short wavelength light (for fiber connections).
    - Other letters might add more specifics, like wavelength or distance.

## Key Takeaways
- Ethernet's universal standards (from IEEE) make global connectivity possible.
- Choose a standard based on your needs: speed, distance, and cable type.
- Names are helpful hints, but read the full standard for accuracy—don't rely just on the name!
