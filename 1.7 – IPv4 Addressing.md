# IPv4 Configuration

These notes summarize the lecture on IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) in a simple, easy-to-understand way. I've organized it into sections with bullet points for clarity. IPv4 is the common way devices get unique addresses to talk on networks—think of it as a device's "phone number" for the internet.

## What is an IPv4 Address?
- Every device needs a unique IP address to communicate using IPv4.
- Format: Four numbers (octets) separated by periods, e.g., 192.168.1.165.
- Works at OSI Layer 3 (Network layer)—handles routing data between networks.
- Structure: 32 bits total (4 octets of 8 bits each), or 4 bytes.
  - Each octet ranges from 0 to 255 (max value for 8 bits).
  - Binary example: 192.168.1.131 = 11000000.10101000.00000001.10000011.

## Key Components for Network Communication
- **IP Address**: Your device's unique ID on the network.
- **Subnet Mask**: Defines the network's "neighborhood" (subnet).
  - Example: 255.255.255.0.
  - Helps devices know what's local vs. remote—used locally, not sent over the network.
- **Default Gateway**: IP of the local router for sending data outside your subnet.
  - Example: 192.168.1.1 (must be on your local network).
  - Set by your network admin.

## Special IP Addresses
- **Loopback Address**: Tests your own device without knowing its real IP.
  - Range: 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254 (commonly 127.0.0.1).
  - Use: Ping 127.0.0.1 to check if your IP software (stack) works.
- **Reserved Addresses**: For future use or testing—never assign to devices.
  - Range: 240.0.0.1 to 254.255.255.254 (Class E addresses).
- **Virtual IP Address (VIP)**: Not tied to a physical network card.
  - Used for virtual machines (VMs) or internal router references.
  - Allows consistent addressing inside devices.

## IP Configuration Methods
- **Manual Configuration**: Old way—manually enter IP, mask, and gateway on each device.
  - Tedious; requires revisiting devices for changes.
- **Automatic via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:
  - Modern way—devices get IP settings automatically when connecting.
  - Handles wired or wireless; enables instant internet access.
- **Link-Local Addresses (APIPA - Automatic Private IP Addressing)**:
  - Fallback when no DHCP server is available.
  - Range: 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254 (usable: 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255; first/last 256 reserved).
  - Limited: Only local subnet communication—no routing to internet.
  - How it works: Device picks a random address, checks via ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) if it's free.

## Private IP Addresses and NAT
- **Problem with IPv4**: Only about 4 billion addresses total— we've run out due to too many devices.
- **Solution: Private IPs**: Reserved ranges for internal networks only (not routable on public internet).
  - Defined in RFC 1918 (Request for Comments document).
  - Allows reuse inside companies/homes without conflicting globally.
- **How to Access Internet?**: Use Network Address Translation (NAT).
  - Converts private IP to public IP at the router.
  - Your home device might have a private IP but browses the web via NAT.
- **Private IP Ranges** (from RFC 1918):
  - **10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255** (/8 CIDR, subnet mask 255.0.0.0):
    - Over 16 million addresses (Class A equivalent).
    - Host bits: 24.
  - **172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255** (/12 CIDR, subnet mask 255.240.0.0):
    - Over 1 million addresses (16 Class B blocks).
    - Host bits: 20.
  - **192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255** (/16 CIDR, subnet mask 255.255.0.0):
    - Over 65,000 addresses (256 Class C blocks).
    - Host bits: 16.
- Note: Upcoming videos cover CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) and IP classes in detail.

## Key Takeaways
- IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses for unique device IDs; needs mask and gateway for full setup.
- Automatic config (DHCP/APIPA) beats manual—DHCP for full access, APIPA for local only.
- Private IPs + NAT extend IPv4's life by reusing addresses internally.
- Special addresses like loopback help troubleshooting; reserved ones are off-limits.
- Check your device's IP—it's probably private (e.g., 192.168.x.x) if at home.
